# Contributing to logdissect
Contributions are welcome in the form of code or testing feedback.

## Testing
User feedback helps logdissect get better. All issues and comments can be directed to the [issues page on GitHub](https://github.com/dogoncouch/logdissect/issues), or emailed to [dpersonsdev@gmail.com](mailto:dpersonsdev@gmail.com). Please ensure you are using the latest release. 

## Coding
If you have a bug fix, or an idea for a module, we would love to hear about it! You can start an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/dogoncouch/logdissect/issues), or email the author at [dpersonsdev@gmail.com](mailto:dpersonsdev@gmail.com). All new modules should be based on the `dev` branch.

### Parser Modules
Creating a parser module is as simple as coming up with a regular expression, and some fields for it to parse. Parse modules are not limited to built-in fields; any field names can be defined. There is an example blank parser in `logdissect/parsers/blank.py`. Set the `datestamp_type` attribute for automatic date stamp conversion, which is required for merging and sorting logs. The options for `datestamp_type` are as follows:

- `standard` - Standard syslog date stamps
- `nodate` - Time stamps with no date (i.e. tcpdump)
- `iso` - ISO8601 timestamps
- `unix` - Unix timestamps
- `now` - Always set date stamp to time parsed
- `None` - Skip conversion

The name of your parse module should be added to the `all` variable and imported in `logdissect/parsers/__init__.py`. More information on parser modules can be found in the [API documentation](README-API.md#parser-modules).

### Filter Modules
Creating a filter module is a bit more difficult. Check out the [filter API documentation](README-API.md#filters-modules), and look at existing filter modules to get an idea of how filters work. Once you have created a filter module, add it to the `all` variable and import it in `logdissect/filters/__init__.py`.

### Output Modules
Check out the [output API documentation](README-API.md#output-modules), and look at existing output modules to get an idea of how outputs work. Once you have created an output module, add it to the `all` variable and import it in `logdissect/output/__init__.py`.
