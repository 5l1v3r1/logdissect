# Introduction
## Synopsis
    import logdissect
    myparser = logdissect.parsers.syslogbsd.ParseModule()
    attribute_tuple = myparser.parse_line(<RAW_LINE>)
    logdataobject = myparser.parse_log(<LOG_FILE_PATH>)
    logentryobject = logdissect.data.LogEntry()

## Description
The logdissect module comes with the logdissect log analysis program. It contains objects which can be used to parse log lines and files, and store log information.

# Objects and Methods

## Parsers
### logdissect.parsers.\<parser>.ParseModule()
Replace \<parser\> with one of the available parsers:

- `` syslogbsd `` - standard syslog
- `` syslogiso `` - syslog with ISO 8601 datestamp
- `` nohost `` - syslog with no host attribute
- `` tcpdump `` - tcpdump terminal output
- `` ldjson `` - logdissect JSON output
    
Parsers contain two methods (except the ldjson parser, which has no parse\_line() method):

### parse\_file(\<file>)
Accepts a filename as input, and returns a LogData object (described below).

Parsers have a tzone attribute that uses standard ISO 8601 offset to UTC (e.g. `+0500`, `-0200`); if not set, logdissect will attempt to get current time zone data from the local system (unless a time zone is already present, such as in the syslogiso parser, or the ldjson parser).

### parse\_line(\<line>)
Accepts a log line as input, and returns a tuple containing attributes. Tuples vary from parser to parser; their values are described in the docstrings for each parse\_line() method.

## Data Objects
### logdissect.data.LogEntry()
LogEntry is the data type for a single log entry. LogEntry objects have the following attributes:
- `parser`
- `date_stamp_noyear`
- `date_stamp`
- `date_stamp_utc`
- `tzone` - time zone
- `raw_text`
- `raw_stamp`
- `facility`
- `severity`
- `message`
- `source_path` - the file it was parsed from
- `source_host`
- `source_port`
- `source_process`
- `source_pid`
- `dest_host`
- `dest_port`
- `protocol`

LogEntry objects have one method:
- `_utc_date` - uses the datestamp and tzone extrapolate a UTC timestamp

### logdissect.data.LogData()
LogData is the data type for a single log. LogData objects have the following attributes:
- `entries` (a list containing LogEntry objects)
- `source_path` (the file it was parsed from)
- `source_file`
- `source_file_mtime`
- `parser`

LogData objects have a few sorting methods:
- `` sort_time() `` - sorts entries by their `date_stamp_utc` attribute
- `` sort_path()  `` - sorts by path
- `` sort_facility `` - sorts by facility, then severity

### logdissect.data.LogDataSet()
LogDataSet is the data type for a logdissect project. LogDataSet objects have the following attributes:
- `data_set` - a list containing LogData objects
- `finalized_data` - a LogData object to hold all of the hold logs

LogDataSet objects also have one method:
- `` merge_logs() `` - merges the logs in `data_set` and sorts them using LogData's `sort_time()` method
